The program should define a Rectangle class with instance variables for width and height, and include the following:

1) A default constructor that sets width and height to 1.
A parameterized constructor that sets width and height to provided values.
2) A method to calculate the area of the rectangle.
3). An overloaded method to calculate the area that accepts width and height as parameters.
4) A main method to create instances of Rectangle and display their areas."

It allows for more flexibility and the ability to assign values that are computed or obtained during the execution of the program.","The 'this' keyword in Java is used to refer to the current object within an instance method or constructor. It is used to distinguish between instance variables and parameters with the same name, and to call other constructors in the same class (constructor chaining).",Garbage collection in Java is the process by which the JVM automatically identifies and discards objects that are no longer referenced or needed by the application. This helps in freeing up memory resources and preventing memory leaks.,"Type conversion in Java is the automatic or implicit conversion of one data type to another (e.g., from int to double) performed by the compiler. Casting, on the other hand, is the explicit conversion of one data type to another (e.g., from double to int) using the cast operator.","Nested classes and inner classes in Java are used to logically group classes that are only used in one place, increase encapsulation, and improve readability and maintainability. Inner classes (non-static nested classes) have access to the members of their enclosing class, including private members, which allows for more tightly coupled interactions.",https://drive.google.com/open?id=11fhbneaCCEDTFV_iNzl7U2h5GZFbXjcr
