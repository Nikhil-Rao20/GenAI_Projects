However, the student made a mistake in the overloaded method `calcArea(double w, double h)` by not using the parameters `w` and `h` to calculate the area. This caused the third output to be incorrect. Everything else in the code and output is correct.","Area: 1.0

The default constructor and parameterized constructor are correctly implemented. The default values are incorrect in the default constructor. The student correctly calculates the area in the getArea() method, but there is a mistake in the overloaded getArea(double w, double h) method where the width and height parameters are not used. This results in incorrect output for the third rectangle area calculation. Hence, marks are deducted for the mistake in the method implementation which affects the output.","Area: 4.0
